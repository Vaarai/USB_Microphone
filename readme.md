# Electret microphone PCB

## Description

This microphone project consist of an electret microphone capsule wired to a home-made USB sound card based on a TS972 dual low noise op-amp and a STM32F446 microcontroller.

![FinalMicPicture (WIP)]()

## Software

Work in progress !!!

## Hardware

The PCB was designed with [Altium Designer](https://www.altium.com/) and printed by [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/). 

Want to reproduce this design but don't have an Altium license ? 

Don't worry, all necessary fabrication files are located in the [Output (WIP)](./Output) directory.

If you don't want to modify the design, skip "Generating the fabrication files"

#### Generating the fabrication files
- Follow [this tutorial](https://support.jlcpcb.com/article/42-how-to-export-altium-pcb-to-gerber-files) to export the fabrication files once you've modified the design
- Continue with the steps below

#### Ordering the PCB at JLCPCB : 
- Go to [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) and upload the .zip file
- In the PCB parameters set "Impedance" to "Yes" and select "JLC7628"
